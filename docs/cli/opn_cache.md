## opn cache

Update and view info of the cache

### Synopsis

opn uses a cache to speed up lookups of MIME types and paths to desktop files.
When desktop or mimeapps.list files are changed, either from the user manually changing it, or as
a result of the installation of a program, this cache can become out-of-date.

To update the cache, use "opn cache update".

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for cache
```
